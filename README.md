# ntfy-shellscripts

A few scripts for the amazing ntfy project: (https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy)
They are quick and dirty, but works for my use case.

ntfy.sh is a generic script, *arr scripts are used for the specific service. Same with SABnzbd.

read_notify.sh and folder_notify.sh are two quick scripts that sends notifications when new files are added.
